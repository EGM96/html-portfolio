<p class="intro">Hi, I’m Emily Marks — a flight paramedic in Eastern North Carolina now transitioning into software development, with a growing interest in game development and AI.
I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Microsoft Power Platform - just trying to get my feet wet. However, I'm really interested in how AI can be used to enhance interactivity, storytelling, and user experience in games and apps.
My background in emergency medicine taught me how to think critically under pressure, solve problems in real time, and communicate clearly — skills I’m now applying to tech as I build my foundation.
While I’m still early in my journey, I’m passionate about creating tools and experiences that feel thoughtful, useful, and human — and I’m excited to keep growing in this space. As my skills improve, so will this website, so make sure to keep an eye out!</p>
